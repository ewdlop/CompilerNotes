Ensuring that different legal languages compile to the same Intermediate Language (IL) involves creating a common IL representation that can express the semantics of both languages and then writing compilers for each language that generate this common IL. This process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Define a Common Intermediate Language (IL):**
   Create a common IL that can represent the constructs of both legal languages.

2. **Write Parsers for Each Language:**
   Write parsers for each legal language that generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the respective language.

3. **Translate AST to Common IL:**
   Write translation functions that convert the AST of each language to the common IL.

4. **Generate Output:**
   Use the common IL to generate the final output (e.g., executable code, documentation, etc.).

### Step 1: Define a Common Intermediate Language (IL)

Let's define a simple common IL that can represent the constructs of legal languages:

```haskell
data IL = ILSection Number [ILClause] deriving Show
data ILClause = ILClause Number ILStatement deriving Show
data ILStatement = ILStatement ILSubject ILVerb ILObject (Maybe [ILCondition]) deriving Show
data ILCondition = ILCondition ILSubject ILVerb ILObject deriving Show
data ILSubject = ILIndividual | ILEntity | ILCourt | ILProperNoun String deriving Show
data ILVerb = ILShall | ILMust | ILMay | ILEntitledTo deriving Show
data ILObject = ILComplyWith ILRequirement | ILAction ILActionType deriving Show
data ILRequirement = ILTaxPayment | ILLegalObligations | ILRegulations deriving Show
data ILActionType = ILPayFine | ILSubmitReport | ILAttendHearing deriving Show
type Number = String
```

### Step 2: Write Parsers for Each Language

Let's assume we have two different legal languages with different syntax but similar semantics. We'll write parsers for each language.

**Parser for Language 1 (using the previously defined parser structure):**

```haskell
-- Parser for Language 1
parseLaw1 :: Parser Law
parseLaw1 = lawParser

-- Translation functions from Language 1 AST to Common IL
translateLaw1ToIL :: Law -> IL
translateLaw1ToIL (Law section sections) = ILSection (translateSectionToIL section) (map translateSectionToIL sections)

translateSectionToIL :: Section -> ILSection
translateSectionToIL (Section num clauseList) = ILSection num (translateClauseListToIL clauseList)

translateClauseListToIL :: ClauseList -> [ILClause]
translateClauseListToIL (ClauseList clauses) = map translateClauseToIL clauses

translateClauseToIL :: Clause -> ILClause
translateClauseToIL (Clause num statement) = ILClause num (translateStatementToIL statement)

translateStatementToIL :: Statement -> ILStatement
translateStatementToIL (Statement subj verb obj conds) = ILStatement (translateSubjectToIL subj) (translateVerbToIL verb) (translateObjectToIL obj) (fmap translateConditionsToIL conds)

translateSubjectToIL :: Subject -> ILSubject
translateSubjectToIL Individual = ILIndividual
translateSubjectToIL Entity = ILEntity
translateSubjectToIL Court = ILCourt
translateSubjectToIL (ProperNoun name) = ILProperNoun name

translateVerbToIL :: Verb -> ILVerb
translateVerbToIL Shall = ILShall
translateVerbToIL Must = ILMust
translateVerbToIL May = ILMay
translateVerbToIL IsEntitledTo = ILEntitledTo

translateObjectToIL :: Object -> ILObject
translateObjectToIL (ComplyWith req) = ILComplyWith (translateRequirementToIL req)
translateObjectToIL (Action act) = ILAction (translateActionToIL act)

translateRequirementToIL :: Requirement -> ILRequirement
translateRequirementToIL TaxPayment = ILTaxPayment
translateRequirementToIL LegalObligations = ILLegalObligations
translateRequirementToIL Regulations = ILRegulations

translateActionToIL :: Action -> ILActionType
translateActionToIL PayFine = ILPayFine
translateActionToIL SubmitReport = ILSubmitReport
translateActionToIL AttendHearing = ILAttendHearing

translateConditionsToIL :: Conditions -> [ILCondition]
translateConditionsToIL (Conditions conds) = map translateConditionToIL conds

translateConditionToIL :: Condition -> ILCondition
translateConditionToIL (Condition subj verb obj) = ILCondition (translateSubjectToIL subj) (translateVerbToIL verb) (translateObjectToIL obj)
```

**Parser for Language 2:**

Assuming Language 2 has a different syntax but similar semantics. We would write a separate parser for Language 2 that generates a similar AST and then translate it to the common IL.

```haskell
-- Define the parser for Language 2 (assuming different syntax)
-- This is just a placeholder, actual implementation would depend on the specific syntax of Language 2
parseLaw2 :: Parser Law
parseLaw2 = undefined  -- Placeholder for actual parser implementation

-- Translation functions from Language 2 AST to Common IL
translateLaw2ToIL :: Law -> IL
translateLaw2ToIL = translateLaw1ToIL  -- Assuming similar AST structure, reuse the same translation functions
```

### Step 3: Generate Output

Finally, use the common IL to generate the desired output. Here, we'll just print the IL for demonstration purposes.

```haskell
-- Main function for testing the parsers and IL generation
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let input1 = "Section 1: Clause 1: individual shall comply with tax payment if individual must comply with legal obligations and entity may comply with regulations Section 2: Clause 2: entity may submit report"
    let input2 = "Section 1: Clause 1: person must comply with tax payment if person must follow legal obligations and organization can comply with regulations Section 2: Clause 2: organization can submit report"
    
    case parse parseLaw1 "" input1 of
        Left err -> print err
        Right result -> putStrLn (show (translateLaw1ToIL result))
    
    case parse parseLaw2 "" input2 of
        Left err -> print err
        Right result -> putStrLn (show (translateLaw2ToIL result))
```

### Summary

1. **Define a common intermediate language (IL) that can represent the constructs of both legal languages.**
2. **Write parsers for each legal language to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST).**
3. **Translate each AST to the common IL using translation functions.**
4. **Generate the desired output (e.g., print the IL, compile to executable code, generate documentation, etc.) from the common IL.**

By following these steps, you ensure that different legal languages can be compiled to the same IL, making it easier to handle multiple legal languages in a unified way.
